# Intro

Welcome to my API designed to create a remote server
for applications dealing with your tasks in day!

The following will be recommendations for a
comfortable server launch for you.

Enjoy!

# For work

In order to start your server carefully follow all
the steps below.

## Step one

To start the server now you need to prepare a little,
namely to install the package without which it is
not possible to start the server.

NPM - terminal command is: `npm init`. This stage
is important because at the moment there are no
**node modules** in your working directory.
At this stage, all dependencies are installed,
so do not skip it!

## Step two

Let's start your server, for this we will use the
command `npm run server`.

This command uses the **nodemon** package that we
obtained in the previous step.

But if suddenly something went wrong, and your
server did not start, do not worry, use the
default command: `node app.js` .

This command is deprived of the advantages that
**nodemon** gives us, but with almost 100%
probability it will start your server.
